issue: D:/$RECYCLE.BIN allocated 40GB 

what is $RECYCLE.BIN?

The $RECYCLE.BIN folder is a folder that contains information about the trash. 
The reason why this folder occurs for each partition is that each partition is logically a different space, 
so when you remove files and folders from that partition, the file information moves to the trash space of each partition. 

However, the Trash displayed within Windows displays information stored in the Trash space of all partitions for ease of administration.
